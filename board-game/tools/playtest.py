"""playtest.py — gate R1c, the empirical half of "is this a game?". No LLM.

    python3 board-game/tools/playtest.py board-game/ideas/<slug>

`rules_check.py` proves the rules and the bill describe the same game.
`board-game-lens-rules` reads the rules and gives an opinion. Neither one
plays. Both surviving lens reviews in this repo end by deferring their real
doubts to a playtest that did not exist:

    blindcap:  "Watch item for playtest, not a failure ... it should be measured."
    spineward: "should be re-examined during playtest."

This is that playtest. It does not ask a model whether the game was fun. It
loads an executable model of the rules, plays it several thousand times with
scripted policies of increasing strength, and reports numbers.

## The engine, and why writing it is half the value

An agent (`board-game-rules-engineer`) turns `idea.json` into
`<idea>/playtest/engine.py`. Every place the rules do not say what happens is
a place that agent cannot write a branch, and the discipline is that it must
NOT guess: it either raises `Undefined("rules:turn[5]: ...")` at that point, or
registers the guess in `ASSUMPTIONS` so this harness can play the game both
ways and see whether the reading matters. A rules gap found while writing the
engine is worth more than any number below, because it comes with the exact
rule that has to be rewritten.

The engine contract, all of it:

    SLUG        = "millbind"
    PLAYERS     = (2, 4)          # seat counts the engine supports
    MAX_TURNS   = 400             # the author's own cap on a sane game
    MOVE_KINDS  = ("place", "shift", "pass")   # every action the rules define
    HIDDEN_INFO = False           # does any seat know something another does not?
    ASSUMPTIONS = [{"id": "shift_adjacency", "rule": "rules:turn[5]",
                    "question": "may a mill shift onto a pin adjacent to another mill?",
                    "chosen": "yes", "alternative": "no"}]
    CHOICES     = {"shift_adjacency": "chosen"}   # this harness flips these

    new_game(n_players, rng) -> state
    player_to_move(state)    -> seat index
    legal_moves(state)       -> list of moves, each with a `.kind` str
    apply_move(state, move, rng) -> state   (may mutate; must return it)
    is_over(state)           -> bool
    scores(state)            -> list of floats, one per seat, valid any time
    winners(state)           -> list of seat indices, valid once over

    determinize(state, seat, rng) -> state    # hidden-information games:
                                              # resample what `seat` cannot see
    observation(state, seat) -> plain data    # hidden-information games:
                                              # only what `seat` may look at

Without `determinize`, a lookahead policy in a hidden-information game is an
oracle that can see the face-down tiles, so its win rate would be an upper
bound rather than a skill measurement. `HIDDEN_INFO` is declared separately
from `determinize` existing precisely so that the harness can tell "this game
has nothing to hide" apart from "this engine forgot to hide it".

`observation` is what `table` mode shows a player, and the two hooks check
each other: resampling what a seat cannot see must not change what that seat
observes. If it does, the observation is leaking or the determinization is
rewriting something public, and either makes every transcript from that table
worthless. That cross-check needs no knowledge of the game and runs on every
hidden-information engine.

## Who sits the baseline

Almost everything below is read off a table of scripted players, so which
script that is matters more than any threshold here. One ply of score
maximising is competent in a placement game and actively suicidal in a
push-your-luck one, where it takes another tile every time because the score
goes up now. So the two candidates play each other first and the winner sits
the baseline, reported by name.

## What the numbers mean

- **termination** — every playout must reach a natural end. Anything else is a
  game that can hang at a real table.
- **deadlock** — a position with no legal move and no ending. Almost always a
  rule that forgot to say "if you cannot act, pass".
- **decisions** — how many legal moves a turn really offers, and how often the
  answer is exactly one. A turn with one option is not a turn.
- **depth** — the skill ladder: random, then greedy, then flat Monte Carlo. If
  a policy that looks a full game ahead cannot beat one throwing dice, there is
  nothing to be good at. This is the strongest single measure here.
- **seat bias** — identical policies, all seats, thousands of games. This is
  the one that Deep Claim died of, in the owner's own words: "an optimal
  strategy for the first player to always win".
- **runaway** — how often whoever leads at the halfway point simply wins.
- **length** — real turn counts against `playtime_min`.
- **dead moves** — an action the rules define, that is legal, and that the
  strongest policy never once chooses.
- **sensitivity** — each declared assumption played both ways. If flipping it
  moves the headline numbers, the ambiguity is blocking and the rules have to
  settle it. If nothing moves, it is cosmetic and can be left alone.

Exit 0 = PASS, 1 = FAIL, 2 = the engine itself is broken or missing (which is
not a verdict on the game). `--report-only` always exits 0: that is shadow
mode, for running the gate before its thresholds have been calibrated.

# to get out of a corner. That is the whole reason to seat them behind it.
#
# A session stores a seed and the list of choices, never a serialised state:
# the position is recomputed by replaying from the seed every time, so a
# session file stays readable, diffable, and impossible to desync from the
# engine without the replay noticing.
