"""Sandboxed cadpy-backed runner — invoked once per agent tool call.

The agent runs ``python scripts/cad path/to/model.py`` (or a project dir).
That spawns a fresh subprocess that pre-imports ``cadquery`` + ``cadpy``
(so their lazy deps land before the import allow-list kicks in), enforces
rlimits, installs the import allow-list, and hands the project dir to
``cadpy.generation.generate_step``. cadpy reads ``main.py``, calls the
user's ``gen_step()`` (or back-compat ``result = …``) inside this same
sandbox process, and writes:

  <stem>.step   <stem>.stl   <stem>.step.json

The parent (this module's ``run_sandboxed_sync``) handles wall-clock kills
and JSON unwrapping for the CLI.

Single-file mode: the parent CLI synthesizes a tempdir with the user's
``.py`` copied as ``main.py`` before spawning the worker — cadpy's entry
point assumes a project shape.
