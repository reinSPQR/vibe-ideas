# CADCode — create or fully redesign 3D CAD via CadQuery

## Purpose

Turn natural-language descriptions of 3D parts into printable, inspectable
3D models. The source of truth is **CadQuery Python** (B-rep on OpenCASCADE
— same kernel as SolidWorks / FreeCAD). Every generated `.py` file is a
small, editable parametric program. The user owns the file; tweak
parameters, re-render, re-print.

Optimised for **hobbyist 3D printing**, not commercial CAD. The deliverable
is an archival STEP plus a watertight STL that the user's slicer can ingest
and that the viewer renders as the preview.

An existing project does not imply a small edit: follow the worker's semantic
route. For a VISUAL REDESIGN, treat the rejected exterior and topology as
replaceable, use the full build/render loop below, and compare the new form with
the supplied reference. A LOCAL ADJUSTMENT keeps the shared CAD reasoning policy
but uses the compact `remix` profile and its one-build validation gate.

## Treat the design as a project

**A design is a small software project, not a single script.** Trivial parts
(a cube with a hole, a plate, a single hex tray) fit in one `.py` file.
Anything bigger — multi-part assemblies, designs with many features, any
part with more than ~120 lines of code — gets a project directory.

A project looks like:

```
my_design/
├── cad_project.json     stable CREATE → EDIT/REMIX identity
├── spec.md             design intent (English, human-readable)
├── params.py           ALL dimensions + manufacturing constants
├── validation.py       runtime constraints (printability, fit, sanity)
├── main.py             entrypoint — defines `gen_step()` (preferred) or
│                       assigns `result` (legacy single-file form)
├── parts/              one file per physical part
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base.py
│   └── cover.py

│   └── __init__.py
└── assemblies/         named placement of physical parts
    ├── __init__.py
    └── product.py
```

`scripts/cad <project_dir>/` calls cadpy's artifact pipeline, which reads
``main.py`` with the project directory on ``sys.path`` (so ``from params
import Params`` and ``from parts.base import …`` work), then calls
``gen_step()``. **Use `Skill(skill='cadcode')` and `Read`
`templates/project_skeleton/` when you need the canonical layout** — copy
it to the user's workspace, edit, run.

Rules of the project format:

- **`cad_project.json` is the lifecycle identity.** When copying the template,
  set `artifactStem` to the project directory's stable semantic name and keep
  `model.parts` in the same order, with the same IDs, as the named
  `cq.Assembly` children. Update both together only when the user intentionally
  adds, removes, or rebinds a physical part. `scripts/cad` reads this stem;
  never pass a different `--stem` for a canonical project.
- **All dimensions live in `params.py`.** Geometry code never hardcodes
  numbers. The user (or you next turn) edits a value once; nothing else
  changes. Bad: `.box(120, 80, 35).shell(-3)`. Good: `.box(p.width, p.depth, p.height).shell(-p.wall)`.
- **`main.py` defines `gen_step()`** at module scope. It returns one of:
  a ``cq.Workplane`` / ``cq.Shape`` (single solid), a ``cq.Assembly``
  (multi-part hierarchy with names + colors + locations), or an
  envelope ``dict`` like ``{"shape": <…>, "stl": True, "mesh_tolerance":
  0.03}`` when you want to tune mesh fidelity or request extra output
  formats (see the [Artifact-control envelope](#artifact-control-envelope)
  section). The legacy ``result = <shape>`` form is still accepted for
  trivial single-file scripts — the runner treats it as if
  ``gen_step()`` returned ``result``.
- **Every mating interface shares one dimension.** Both halves of a mate
  derive from a **single** base value in `params.py`, with the FDM clearance
  applied in exactly **one** place — never size the two halves independently.
  Full rule + the helpers that enforce it: step 6 of "Running the loop".
- **One file per physical part** under `parts/`. Each part knows nothing
  about its siblings; it builds in its own local frame.
- **Each feature is its own function.** `add_left_usb_c_cutout(part, p)`,
  not nested inline. Compose them in a pipeline so each edit has a clear
  target.
- **Assembly = positioning + hierarchy, never part geometry.** Build parts in
  `parts/`, then place them as stable, named `cq.Assembly` children in
  `assemblies/`. Boolean-union shapes only when they are one manufactured
  part; keep separately printable or removable parts separate so the next
  EDIT/REMIX turn can address them by name.
- **`validation.py` runs at startup** with `assert` checks on Params.
  Bad dimensions fail loudly before paying a render cycle.

### Artifact-control envelope

For most parts, return the shape directly from ``gen_step()`` and let the
defaults handle the export. When you need control:

```python
def gen_step():
    body = build_my_part(p)
    return {
        "shape": body,                       # required: cq.Workplane | cq.Shape
        "mesh_tolerance": 0.03,              # mm, default 0.05
        "mesh_angular_tolerance": 2.0,       # deg, default 3.0
    }
```

The envelope keys (``shape`` | ``instances`` | ``children`` for content;
``mesh_tolerance`` / ``mesh_angular_tolerance`` for output) are all that the
cadpy pipeline accepts — unknown keys raise. The ``.stl`` is always written;
no envelope flag is needed.

See `references/project-structure.md` for the long version.

## The loop

The cadcode skill turns you into a self-correcting CAD designer. **You close
the feedback loop yourself** — do not hand a possibly-broken model to the
user for verification.

```
understand task → inspect repo → make plan → edit .py → run scripts/cad
       ↑                                                       ↓
       └────────── fix ←─── read failure / render ←────────────┘
```

What "fix" means in practice:

- ``ok=false``: read the traceback, change the smallest responsible line, re-run.
- ``is_solid=false`` or volume far off expected: load `references/repair-loop.md`, classify, fix, re-run.
- ``warnings`` non-empty: deterministic geometry defects — any non-`info` warning is **blocking** (full taxonomy: Non-negotiables). For ``disconnected_bodies``, anchor the floating feature to the body (`references/patterns/anchor-to-body.md`) or, for a mechanism, solve the joint so the links actually meet (`references/kinematic-placement.md`). For ``collision``, reposition or resize so mating faces meet at the right clearance. Fix and re-run.
- Preview STL looks wrong (proportions off, hole misplaced, parts misaligned, a member poking through a plate): edit the `.py` and re-run. **Always inspect every part** — geometry can be valid (`is_solid=true`, no warnings) but still wrong.

You have everything you need to close the loop on your own:

- The user's prompt and any attached reference image (inspect).
- The current workspace files including prior `.py` versions (inspect).
- `scripts/cad` for compile + solid check + STEP/STL/metadata export (run).
- `scripts/check` for a quick validation when you only need a sanity check (run).
- This SKILL.md + the references for domain knowledge (plan).

**Iterate until the model is correct.** Soft cap of 4 iterations before you
ask the user a clarifying question — past that, you're probably guessing
about user intent rather than fixing a geometry bug. Closing the loop is
what makes you feel like an engineer instead of an autocomplete.

### Production CREATE implementation contract

When Vibe's CREATE implementation system prompt is active, the bounded worker
contract overrides the generic/manual loop above. After writing one coherent
source version, run exactly:

```bash
create-check <absolute-project-dir-or-generator.py>
```

Use the smallest editable source that owns the requested geometry. A normal
single physical part defaults to one workspace-root `main.py` with dimensions at
the top and `gen_step()` returning the final solid. A small multi-part design may
also stay in that file by returning a `cq.Assembly` with stable named children.
The project template, `cad_project.json`, `spec.md`, `params.py`, `validation.py`,
and split `parts/` tree are optional lifecycle structure, not CREATE acceptance
requirements. Do not read or reproduce them unless genuine source complexity
requires a split project. Before the first gate result, do not inspect cadpy or
cadlib internals and do not run ad-hoc Python API probes; write the coherent
source directly, then let the gate report any source-addressable defect.

`create-check` owns one `scripts/cad` build/export, blocking-warning and artifact
checks (including one archival STEP and printable STL for every named part), one
standard all-part review with x/y/z sections, and private QA montage generation.
Therefore, in this mode:

- do **not** call `scripts/cad`, `scripts/check`, or `scripts/review` separately;
- do **not** inspect cadpy/cadlib internals or write ad-hoc Python probes merely
  to duplicate facts the gate reports;
- rerun only after a source change that addresses the returned FAIL;
- read each `review.targets` montage exactly once after PASS; and
- if those montages match the approved plan, finish immediately without another
  build, review, source edit, or speculative polish.

The gate fingerprints source, returns the cached result for an unchanged tree,
and hard-caps the claim at three distinct source versions. This is an execution
budget, not permission to make three attempts: aim to PASS on the first. A real
visual defect may use one focused source fix; exhausted budget means stop rather
than opening an unbounded repair loop. This bounded rule applies only to Vibe
cloud CREATE implementation. Desktop/manual cadcode use and full-form redesign
routes keep the generic loop unless their own system prompt opts in.

## Plan-phase design discipline

When Vibe runs you in its **Plan phase** (enforced by the phase system
prompt: no writing `.py`, no running the generator), you write no geometry —
you produce the plan the user approves before the build. That plan
is an **engineering spec**, not a sales pitch. Hold it to five rules:

**Literal constraint contract.** Before deriving anything, copy every explicit
dimension, count, and forbidden feature from the request once as
`owner.feature → exact final requirement → final-geometry check`. Grammar assigns
the owner; exact overall sizes mean final post-boolean extents. Defaults, fit,
and clearance may fill omissions but cannot alter exact values. Each named
locating feature has one positive-geometry owner. The request outranks the plan.
Every static interface states its engagement depth/path and proves the minimum
clearance over the **entire engaged volume or insertion sweep**, not only at one
nominal plane or endpoint. If a taper or other profile changes through the
engagement, make the matching mate geometry or a straight locating foot an
explicit geometry-changing assumption while preserving every literal dimension.
Feature words retain their ordinary geometric scope: a **rim** is the boundary
of an opening. A requested radius language may coordinate the requested rims;
it does not authorize a new fillet on a base, underside, or functional edge.
Ledger rows and derived formulas must be mutually consistent with every
geometry-changing assumption. If a straight foot consumes 3 mm of a 90 mm
profile, for example, a remaining taper spans 87 mm, not 90 mm. On a tapered or
curved wall, **uniform thickness** means the shortest surface-normal distance
unless the user explicitly specifies radial/horizontal thickness. When a tangent
band/shoulder changes the outer profile slope, construct the inner profile as the
true offset of **every** outer segment and join adjacent offset segments at their
mathematical intersection. Do not loft inner vertices at the outer vertices'
heights; that silently changes wall thickness through the transition. On final
cylindrical/conical B-rep faces, call
`cadlib.validation.verify_uniform_wall_thickness` once for every adjacent
outer/inner segment pair after the last geometry-changing operation. An exact
value has no silent smaller, simpler, or best-effort fallback; let the gate fail rather
than changing it. Exact per-part envelopes are measured after every boolean and
fillet in both the undersize and oversize directions. If a rounded edge is the
sole extremum, add an explicit tangent band/shoulder that preserves the exact
final envelope; a parameter or pre-fillet endpoint is not proof. If an assumption
splits a profile into fixed and varying spans, state and use
`varying_span = total_span - fixed_span`; do not also describe the varying
profile as covering the full total span.

1. **Exact measurements.** Every dimension, quantity, and metric is a precise
   number with a unit. Never "about", "roughly", or "approximately" — if you
   don't know a value, derive it (below) or ask the user.
2. **Component-level breakdown.** List each distinct part with its outer
   dimensions, material, and purpose, and state exactly how parts connect —
   joint/feature type, mating dimensions, clearance/tolerance, attachment
   points, alignment. A single-part object still lists its one part.
3. **Physical correctness.** Account for gravity, balance, load-bearing, center
   of mass, structural stability, and FDM layer-line orientation. State your
   assumptions and confirm the design behaves under real-world conditions. Show
   only the checks that apply — for a part with no load case (decorative, a
   loose-fit cover), say so in a clause rather than inventing a load.
4. **Show the math.** For each derived or load-bearing number, show the formula
   and the values used so a reader can check it: `name = formula = value unit`.
5. **Verification checklist.** End the plan with the explicit list the build will
   clear one item at a time, each paired with how it is checked — a SANITY check
   (a number / `validate()` assert / `functional` warning) and a VISUAL check
   (which render, or a **cross-section** for an interior interface). Two groups:
   **(A) per component** — every feature sits on solid material (no tooth / peg /
   boss / rib over a void, hole, or notch) and depths actually reach; **(B) per
   interface** — each mating pair (peg/socket, clutch, gear, tab/slot, lip/groove)
   actually meets and can transmit its force (form-fitting, not a smooth pocket
   over round pegs), with the right clearance and a reachable assembly path.

**Scale to the request.** A trivial edit ("make the wall 2 mm thicker", "move
the holes 5 mm apart") needs only the exact before→after values and any physical
consequence — one to three lines. A fully specified static request — one part or
a small number of named, separately printable parts — that has no named
real-world component to measure, no articulated / kinematic / captive-moving
mechanism, no explicit load/stress target, and whose omissions have safe
printable defaults gets a compact exact-spec plan: aim for 250 words and treat
300 words as a soft ceiling. Every static mating dimension and clearance must
already be supplied or mechanically forced by those literal values. A removable
lid, divider, tray, pot, or other part that only seats, stacks, drops, or
slip-fits into such a fully dimensioned static interface remains eligible;
multi-part alone does not force a full plan. A functional noun such as bracket,
mount, holder, or stand does not by itself justify inventing a load case.
Use a one-line intent, an at-most-eight-row literal ledger with final-geometry
checks, and only geometry-changing assumptions for omissions. Every static
interface row includes its engagement depth/path and minimum-clearance proof over
the whole engaged volume or insertion sweep. Omit Parts,
Measurements, Physics, Form, repeated prose, and implementation code.
Component-dependent, articulated/kinematic, captive-moving, under-specified
mating, explicitly load-rated, or ambiguous designs get the full treatment.

**Aesthetic discipline.** A Vibe part should look like a premium consumer
product (Apple-anchored, but a broad high-end range — see
`references/industrial-design.md`), not a blocky CAD default. For any
user-facing part in a **full plan**, give each part a one-line **`Form`** clause
naming its radius language (the unified corner/edge radius and where it's
applied) and its primary surface treatment (e.g. "4 mm unified vertical radius,
1 mm top chamfer, calm front face, fasteners hidden on the back"). Exact-spec
plans carry only explicitly requested aesthetic constraints in the literal
ledger; they do not invent a `Form` clause. This is **secondary to function and
printability** — never trade away strength, wall thickness, tolerance,
clearance, or print orientation for looks; if an aesthetic choice would
compromise the part, say so and pick function. Trivial edits skip the `Form`
clause.

An explicit prohibition such as **no extra features**, **no decoration**,
**plain**, or **only the listed features** disables invented Form geometry. Do
not add an unrequested fillet, chamfer, edge break, texture, rib, or surface
treatment; keep only radii and features the user actually requested. The
original request outranks any contrary styling phrase in an approved plan.
Do not reinterpret **rim radius language** as permission to round a base or
underside; those are not rims unless the user explicitly names those edges.

For a requested circular opening-rim fillet on revolved or hollow geometry,
avoid `NearestToPointSelector` at the revolve seam. Select the top face locally,
then filter that face's edges to the one with the largest XY radial bounding box.
Keep that selector scoped to the explicitly requested rim.
Never catch a failed fillet and substitute a smaller radius when the requested
radius is exact. When the request explicitly shares one radius language across
named parts, enumerate and apply it to each eligible opening rim; applying it to
one part alone does not satisfy a shared language.
Hard-assert each explicitly sized part's final `BoundingBox` after all booleans
and fillets with a geometric tolerance no looser than 1e-4 mm. Test equality in
both directions; a one-sided `actual <= expected + tolerance` check can silently
accept an undersized part.

**Assembly & functional discipline.** A part that is a valid solid but can't be
assembled or used is a failure — whether it can't be *installed* (a MagSafe stand
whose puck *pocket* is perfect but whose **captive cable + connector collar**
can't pass the opening) or can't *function* (a dial that sits clear of its drive
pegs, so turning it does nothing). Designs with a real component, an articulated
/ kinematic / captive-moving mechanism, or an under-specified mating interface
are not eligible for the exact-spec fast path. Fully dimensioned static seats,
stacks, drop-ins, and slip fits remain eligible as described above. A required
**full plan** must include:
- **Assembly & setup sequence** — the ordered steps to assemble and set up the
  finished print (install each component, route its cable/connector, place the
  device), and the clearance each step needs. Model the WHOLE component,
  including captive cables, connector collars, and plugs — **web-search the
  component's dimensions** (body, cable Ø, connector-collar Ø×len) and state them
  as assumptions the user can correct.
- **Functional requirements** — what it must do (hold / charge / route / rest /
  remove / drive / mesh), each tied to a dimension and carried into the
  Verification checklist (rule 5).

Read `references/component-integration.md` for the discipline. Encode the
constraints two ways (see the build loop): hard `validate()` asserts for
impossible fits, and `functional` warnings for assembly-feasibility. Trivial
edits skip this.

### Where the numbers come from — source them, don't guess

Every number you put in the model comes from exactly one of three places. Know
which, and never invent one.

1. **Real-world dimensions of a named product** (a phone, a motor, a doorbell, a
   bearing you don't recognize, a mount standard, a connector collar) — **web-search
   the manufacturer/catalog spec**, then **state it as an assumption the user can
   correct** and round for printing. Don't carry these from memory; they drift by
   model/region and a confident guess is the classic failure. If a search can't
   pin a specific device, say so and ask the user for the dimension.
2. **Hardware the cadlib helpers already cover** (screws, nuts, bearings, magnets,
   heat-set inserts, common cable jackets) — the helper owns the dimensions; pass
   it a named size (`bearing="608"`, `screw_size="M3"`) and let
   `cadlib/tables.py` supply the geometry. Don't transcribe those numbers into
   your model. For an open-ended fit the helper takes a raw dimension
   (`cable_diameter=…`) — that's where a web-searched value goes.
3. **Generic FDM best-practice** (tolerances, wall thickness, boss sizing, fits) —
   use the rules below, which are formulas, not lookups:

| Best-practice rule | Load for the why |
|---|---|
| `wall = N × nozzle` (0.4 mm nozzle → 0.8 / 1.2 / 1.6 / 2.0 / 2.8 mm; 2.0 mm enclosure, 2.8 mm + ribs load-bearing) | `references/patterns/wall-thickness-rules.md` |
| Clearance hole `= nominal + 0.3–0.4 mm`; self-tap `= major − 0.3 mm`; cbore `= cap-head Ø + 0.5 mm` | `references/hobbyist-defaults.md` |
| Boss OD `= 2·clearance + 2·wall`; screw engagement `= 2·screw-Ø` | `references/patterns/screw-boss.md` |
| FDM slop: press-fit `+0.2`, hand-assembly `+0.4`, snap/interference `0.3–0.5 mm` | `references/hobbyist-defaults.md` |
| Rib vs wall stiffness (one rib ≈ 5–10× cheaper than doubling walls; `h³`) | `references/patterns/rib-stiffener.md` |

Material properties (e.g. PETG ≈ 0.6× PLA stiffness and creeps under sustained
load) are starting assumptions — keep the engineering formula but label the
constant as one to verify/web-search for the user's actual material.

### Physics checklist — what to show

- **Tip-over / balance:** center of mass vs support footprint. Compute the
  horizontal CoM offset and compare to the base edge:
  `x_CoM < base_overhang` ⇒ stable; report the margin.
- **Load path / bearing stress:** where weight enters, what carries it to the
  ground or mount, and the fastener/wall that takes the reaction.
- **Stiffness / deflection:** wall thickness and ribs for the stated load;
  remember doubling thickness is 8× stiffer (`h³`), a rib is usually cheaper.
- **FDM layer orientation:** a load pulling *across* the layer lines is far
  weaker (e.g. boss pull-out drops ~50%). State the print orientation wherever
  strength matters.
- **Build volume:** confirm the part fits the printer (a Bambu bed is ≈ 256 mm
  cube — verify for the user's printer model; cadpy's sanity bound is 200 × 200 mm).
- **Assumptions to state:** material (and its density/stiffness), applied load,
  orientation in use, support condition (free-standing, wall-mounted, clamped).
  Label every assumed input (a phone's mass, a bag's weight) as an assumption
  the user can correct — never present a guess as a measured fact, and never
  fabricate a load just to fill the section. Skip checks that don't apply and
  say why.

End the Physics check with a one-line verdict: stable / load-safe / printable
under the stated assumptions, or the condition that would make it fail.

### Default to ONE premium part; split only when it must come apart

**Most consumer objects are a single, sculpted premium part** — a phone stand, a
knob, a bracket, a wall mount, a vase, a MagSafe stand. Default to **one
well-proportioned solid body** with any component (charger puck, cable, bearing,
phone) integrated into it as a recess / pocket / channel. A premium object reads
as one continuous form, **not a flat plate bolted to a flat base**.

Reach for multiple printed parts **only** when the object physically must come
apart: a lid or removable cover, a part with a moving joint (hinge, linkage), a
shape that can't print in one orientation, or anything larger than the bed. *A
phone stand is one part; a box with a lid is two.* When unsure, choose one part —
a unified body looks better and has nothing to misfit. The multi-part fit /
collision / shared-dimension discipline below applies **only** to designs that
are genuinely several printed parts; never split a single object to satisfy it.

### Spec format — the shape to fill in

> **What I'll make** — one line.
> **Parts** — usually **one**. Give it outer dims, material, purpose. *Only if
> the design is genuinely multi-part*, add an entry per printed part and state
> exactly how each connects (joint type, the shared mating dimension, the
> clearance per side).
> **Form** — the premium read in one line: the unified corner/edge radius and
> the primary surface treatment (the aesthetic discipline above +
> `references/industrial-design.md`). A solid, resolved body — never a thin slab.
> **Measurements & math** — each derived/load-bearing number as
> `name = formula = value unit` (e.g. `wall = 7 perim · 0.4 mm = 2.8 mm`).
> **Physics check** — only the checks that apply (tip-over CoM vs base, load
> path, stiffness, layer orientation, build volume), then a one-line **Verdict**.

**Worked example — MagSafe phone stand (one premium part).** A solid, gently
tapered wedge body — *not* a flat plate: ~75 × 80 mm base, ~95 mm tall, leaning
~12° back; a Ø56 × 3 mm puck recess sunk into the front face, the cable channeled
out the back (model the puck **and** its captive cable + connector collar —
`references/component-integration.md`); 3 mm walls, 4 mm unified vertical radius,
floor ballast low for stability, an 8 mm front lip the phone rests on. One
printed part, charger integrated — mimic `assets/example_magsafe_stand.py`.
(These numbers are illustrative; the puck/cable/collar dimensions are
web-sourced from Apple's spec and stated as assumptions — see rule 1 above.)

*Only if the design is multi-part*, make each connection explicit and numeric
(e.g. "base + lid, 0.2 mm slip fit on a 2 mm lip; four M3 self-tap bosses, 6 mm
engagement, on an 80 × 60 mm bolt pattern") — a multi-part plan that doesn't
state how the parts join is incomplete.

## Use this skill when

The user asks for any of:

- A specific printable part: phone stand, wall hook, bracket, mount, jig,
  enclosure, knob, organizer, hex tray, gridfinity bin, vase, GoPro/action-
  camera adapter, replacement knob, light cover, cable clip.
- A CadQuery `.py` file, parametric model, or STL/STEP output — new or existing.
- A printable replacement part with a stated device + dimensions.
- A follow-up adjustment to editable CadQuery source.
- A reference-led redesign that replaces an existing form or topology.

Do **not** use this skill for: render-only concept art, FEA / simulation, robotics
description files (URDF / SDF), or 2D laser-cut DXF. If a sibling skill is
installed for those domains, use it; otherwise tell the user this skill is
not the right tool.

## Default assumptions

Use these defaults unless the user specifies otherwise:

- **Units**: millimeters.
- **Origin**: center of the main body, base plane on `XY`, height along `+Z`.
- **Output**: closed, positive-volume solids. ``scripts/cad`` reports
  ``is_solid`` in its JSON — do not declare done when it's ``false``. Do
  not add an ``assert <shape>.isValid()`` line to the user's ``.py``;
  cadpy already validates as part of the artifact pipeline.
- **Print bed**: 200×200mm typical FDM. Warn if your model exceeds it.
- **Wall thickness for FDM enclosures**: 2.0–3.0 mm.
- **Cosmetic fillet**: 1.0–2.0 mm where geometry allows.
- **Cable channels / slots**: 2–4 mm wider than the cable / connector.
- **Clearance holes**: `hole = nominal + 0.3–0.4 mm` (so M3 → 3.4 mm, M4 → 4.5 mm,
  M5 → 5.5 mm); self-tap into plastic `= major − 0.3 mm`. For screws/nuts/inserts,
  prefer the cadlib helper with a named size rather than transcribing the hole.
- **Tolerances baked into the print** (FDM, 0.4mm nozzle): assume 0.2 mm
  positive slop on holes the user will press a part into; assume 0.4 mm slop
  on parts the user will assemble by hand.

### Ask only about preferences; decide all engineering silently

Split every open decision into two buckets and treat them oppositely. The user
verifies **taste**, never **geometry**.

- **Personal preferences — only the user can know these. Ask, but sparingly.**
  No "correct" answer; depends on the person or their stuff: which device/phone,
  colour/finish, size for their space, left- vs right-handed, wall- vs desk- vs
  handheld, how many of X it holds. Ask only when the answer actually changes
  geometry, and ask the **fewest, highest-leverage** questions — ideally one,
  never a quiz.
- **Engineering choices — there is a best answer. Never ask; pick it.** Wall
  thickness, clearance/tolerance, fillet radius, joint type (tab-slot vs snap vs
  screw), fastener size and thread, boss sizing, print orientation, which parts
  split out. Decide these from best practice and the references — silently.
  Default-and-state: make the call, note it in one line only if it changes fit
  or load, and move on. Never turn an engineering decision into a question.

The test: *could a competent product designer pick this correctly without
knowing the user?* If yes, it's engineering — decide it.

- Warrants a question (preference): device when "phone stand" names no model;
  portrait vs landscape when both are common; wall mount vs desk stand when not
  implied; capacity ("1 pen or 6").
- Never ask (engineering — just pick, optionally note): wall thickness, fillet
  radius, clearance, joint/fastener type and thread, print orientation, finish,
  print-bed edge chamfer (always yes — it lifts off cleaner).

## Root model

- **Skill directory**: this folder. Tools live at `scripts/cad` and
  `scripts/check`; Vibe cloud CREATE uses the image-owned `create-check` command
  described above.
- **Workspace cwd**: relative target paths resolve from the user's working
  directory. Use absolute paths when you write a `.py` file so subsequent
  tool calls find it.
- **Source = the `.py` file (or project) you wrote**. STEP, STL, and the
  metadata sidecar are *derived*. When the user asks for a change, edit the
  `.py` and re-generate. Do not edit the STL or STEP.
- **Entry function**: ``gen_step()`` at module scope (or the legacy
  ``result =`` form for trivial scripts) — the contract is in the project
  rules above. Without one of these, the runner fails.

## Available tools

The skill lives at ``~/.claude/skills/cadcode/`` (or wherever the user
installed it). From the workspace, the launchers are:

```bash
# Single-file mode: pass any .py file defining gen_step() (or, for
# trivial scripts, ending with a module-level `result = <shape>`).
python ~/.claude/skills/cadcode/scripts/cad   <input.py>      [flags]

# Project mode: pass a directory containing main.py — sibling modules
# (params.py, parts/, features/, assemblies/, validation.py) are
# automatically added to sys.path
python ~/.claude/skills/cadcode/scripts/cad   <project_dir>/  [flags]

python ~/.claude/skills/cadcode/scripts/check <input.py>

# Vibe cloud CREATE only: one bounded build/export/review contract. This command
# replaces separate cad/check/review calls for the CREATE implementation turn.
create-check <project_dir | input.py>
```

Common flags on ``scripts/cad``:

- ``--out-dir DIR``       where artifacts land (default: alongside input)
- ``--stem NAME``         output filename stem (default: input/dir name). Use
  ``<project>_assembled`` for a multi-part `cq.Assembly` so the combined-all-parts
  file is self-describing — see step 5.
- ``--mesh-tolerance MM`` linear meshing tolerance for the STL (default 0.05)
- ``--angular-tolerance DEG``  angular meshing tolerance for the STL (default 3°)
- ``--wall-clock-s S``    subprocess timeout (default 30; bump for complex parts)

Use ``--help`` for the full flag set. Always pass an **absolute path** for
``<input.py>`` or ``<project_dir>`` — the agent's cwd may not be the
user's workspace.

**`scripts/cad`** — primary tool. Runs the CadQuery file (or project) in
an isolated subprocess (rlimit + restricted imports + 30s wall-clock kill)
and writes the canonical artifact set next to the source via the cadpy
pipeline:

- `<name>.step` — full B-rep archival, with XCAF labels + colors.
- `<name>.stl` — slicer-ready mesh, always written. It is also the mesh the
  viewer renders as the preview.
- `<name>.step.json` — source hash, generator metadata, validation summary
  (``is_solid``, ``volume_mm3``, mesh tolerances).
- `<name>_parts/<part>.stl` + `<name>_parts/<part>.stl.json` — assemblies
  only: one STL per named part at its build origin, each with its own JSON
  metadata sidecar (part name, `description`, index, `partOf`, geometry facts,
  `dimensionsMm`, mesh settings) mirroring the integrated `.step.json`. The
  per-part `description` comes from an optional module-level
  ``PART_DESCRIPTIONS = {"<part name>": "<description>"}`` map in `main.py`
  (keyed by the assembly ``.add(name=...)``); absent → `""`.

**Part order is a contract, not a listing.** The `parts[]` array in
`<name>.step.json` is written in **assembled-mesh order**: `parts[i]` is the
i-th mesh of `<name>.stl`, which is the `.add()` occurrence order. The viewer
addresses a clicked mesh by that index and merges the user's per-part color back
onto the same entry, so a mismatch paints the wrong part. cadpy derives both the
assembled mesh and `parts[]` from one occurrence list — never sort the array,
never hand-edit it, and when editing an assembly append `.add()` calls rather
than reordering existing ones (see `references/assembly.md`).

Prints a single JSON line on stdout:
``{ok, step_path, stl_path, metadata_path, is_solid, volume_mm3, bbox,
error?}``.

**`scripts/check`** — quick validator. Runs the `.py` and reports
`is_solid`, `volume_mm3`, manifold status, and any min-wall warnings
without keeping artifacts. Use this to sanity-check a model before paying
for the full export.

## Running the loop

Each phase of the loop in concrete terms:

### 1. Understand the task

Read the user's prompt fully. Classify it: **new part**, **edit of an
existing `.py`**, **render-only review**, or **validation-only check**. If
a reference image was attached, `Read` it first — its dimensions and
style are usually authoritative.

### 2. Inspect the workspace

List the workspace files. If a `.py` exists from a prior turn AND this is
an edit request, `Read` it before writing. Don't regenerate from scratch
when an edit will do — minimal diffs respect the user's prior tweaks.

If you're unsure how to approach a feature (hex grid, tapered shell,
multi-part union), `Read` one of the example assets in this skill's
`assets/` directory and mimic the pattern.

### 3. Make a plan

In your reasoning, write down: parameters (name + value + unit), key
features, build order, and the literal constraint ledger. Preserve its ownership
and negatives when deriving parameters. Catch dimension errors before they cost
a render cycle. For multi-feature parts, decide the union order — most stable
anchor first. (In Vibe's planning phase this becomes the user-facing spec — see
[Plan-phase design discipline](#plan-phase-design-discipline).)

### 4. Edit the `.py`

Write the file with:
- A 1-line docstring at top describing the part.
- Named parameters with units in comments (`PHONE_W = 77  # iPhone 15 PM`).
- A single ``gen_step()`` function at module scope returning the final
  shape (or an envelope ``dict`` to tune mesh tolerance — see
  the [Artifact-control envelope](#artifact-control-envelope) section).

Pick a filename from the part: `phone_stand.py`, `gopro_adapter.py`. Use
absolute paths for the `Write` tool — the workspace cwd is not the skill
directory.

### 5. Run `scripts/cad`

**Vibe cloud CREATE override:** run `create-check <absolute project or .py>`
instead and follow its PASS/FAIL contract. Do not run the command below before or
after it; `create-check` already invokes this exporter exactly once per changed
source version.

```bash
python ~/.claude/skills/cadcode/scripts/cad <abs/path/to/file.py>
```

This compiles, checks `is_solid`, exports STEP + STL + metadata, and prints
a JSON line.

**Canonical output naming.** Do not pass `--stem` for a project containing
`cad_project.json`; its `artifactStem` owns the stable CREATE → EDIT/REMIX
family. A `cq.Assembly` still writes one combined STEP/STL plus named per-part
STLs under `<artifactStem>_parts/`; it does not need an `_assembled` rename.
Use `--stem` only for legacy/single-file input.

### 6. Read the failure (or the render)

**Vibe cloud CREATE override:** a FAIL already contains the source-addressable
stage/error to fix. A PASS contains compact private `review.targets`; read each
target once. Do not re-run individual review commands or inspect every source
PNG separately—the montage contains those standard views and sections.

Don't skip this step. Even when `ok=true is_solid=true`, geometry can be
visually wrong. Work the plan's **literal constraint ledger** and
its **Verification checklist**, when present: clear each item with BOTH its
sanity check (a number / assert / `functional` warning) and its visual check (a
render — a **cross-section** for any interior interface):

- **Prove literal constraints on final geometry.** Measure exact envelopes,
  feature depths, positions, and counts on the final post-boolean solids, not on
  `Params` or a pre-cut body. For every explicitly owned overall size/extent,
  call `cadlib.validation.verify_bbox` after the owner's last boolean; use
  `None` for unspecified axes and do not check the aggregate Assembly unless
  the request explicitly constrains its assembled envelope. For an explicit
  straight cylindrical through-hole pattern, call
  `cadlib.validation.verify_through_hole_pattern` with its final owner, axis,
  centers, diameter, and span. Use `verify_rectangular_through_cut` for a sharp
  rectangular X/Y/Z port and `verify_clearance_box` when an axis-aligned cavity
  must be completely empty. For an explicitly uniform cylindrical/conical wall,
  call `verify_uniform_wall_thickness` on every final adjacent outer/inner face
  pair; a slope transition must use the mathematical intersection of the offset
  segments, not matching-height loft vertices. Confirm every other forbidden
  feature is absent. A
  copied parameter value, global volume, or right-order-of-magnitude bbox is
  not an independent proof. See `references/literal-geometry.md`.

- **Resolve `warnings` first.** Any non-`info` warning in the JSON's
  ``warnings`` array is blocking (full taxonomy: Non-negotiables) — go to
  step 7.
- **Prove the parts fit and don't collide (multi-part designs).** A clean
  pairwise `collision` check only proves the parts don't *overlap*, not that
  they *join*. **The mating rule (canonical):** for every mating interface — a
  tab and its slot, a lip and its groove, a boss and its hole, a peg and its
  socket — both sides derive from **one** source-of-truth dimension in
  `params.py`, with the FDM clearance applied in exactly **one** place. Never
  size the two halves independently: that is how a tab and slot silently drift
  until they jam or fall out. The atomic helpers (`add_nut_trap`,
  `add_open_cable_channel`, `add_screw_post`) already guarantee this; for a
  hand-built mate, derive the second half with `cadlib.fits` — `slot_for(tab,
  fit)` (female for a male) or `peg_for(hole, fit)` (male for a female) — see
  `assets/example_snap_lid_box.py`. Then walk the assembly sequence: there must
  be a real ordered path to put it together (lid drops past the lip, captive
  cable passes the opening). A model with valid solids but unchecked mating is
  **not done**.
- **Look at every part from all directions, AND the assembly.** Run
  ``python scripts/review <project_dir>`` — it renders the assembled model and
  *each named part* from **all directions** (a 3/4 iso plus all six axis-aligned
  faces) under ``<stem>_review/``, auto-cuts the assembly's x/y/z center
  cross-sections, and re-lists the warnings. You **MUST** `Read` **every** PNG it
  produces and look. A whole-assembly preview hides a floating standoff *inside* a
  tray or a small spike on one part — the per-part, all-direction views do not.
  For an interior interface (a peg in a socket, a tooth on a disc, a lip in a
  groove) the center cuts may miss the plane — render a targeted **cross-section**
  there: ``python scripts/review <project_dir> --section <x|y|z>[@offset_mm]``
  (add ``--part <name>`` to cut one part), then `Read` it.
- **Justify each part.** For every part, state in one line what it is for and
  what it connects to (which mounting interface / mating face). If you cannot
  justify a part, or it does not connect to anything, it is a defect — fix it.
- **Clear the Verification checklist, item by item.** For each item do BOTH a
  sanity check and a visual check. **(A) Per component:** every feature sits on
  SOLID material (nothing perched over a void / hole / notch) and depths
  actually reach. **(B) Per interface:** the mating features MEET in the right
  axis and can TRANSMIT their force (a smooth pocket over round pegs can't
  drive; a captive cable's collar must pass its opening). Walk the plan's
  assembly sequence against the renders, cross-sectioning interior interfaces.
  Encode each item as a hard `validate()` assert (impossible fits) **and** a
  `functional` warning returned from `gen_step()`
  (`return {"shape": shape, "warnings": functional_checks(p)}`) — fix the
  geometry/params and re-run until the `.step.json` lists none. See
  `references/component-integration.md`.
- **Critique the look against the premium bar.** Reading those same PNGs, judge
  each part against `references/industrial-design.md`: does it carry one unified
  radius language, or a scatter of raw 90° arrises? Are transitions blended,
  primary surfaces calm, fasteners minimized? The JSON's `sharp_edges` advisory
  (an info warning, never blocking) counts the un-softened convex arrises — drive
  it toward zero on visible faces with `cadlib.styling` (`soften_edges` /
  `break_edges`), **within printability and strength limits**. Refine and re-run
  any part that reads cheap, blocky, or unresolved; leave functional arrises
  sharp. Do this before hand-off — a part that works but looks like a default box
  is not done.
- Compare against the user's prompt and any reference image.
- Check the bbox in the JSON: does it match the intent (right order of
  magnitude, fits on a 200×200mm bed)?

If anything is off — compile error, non-solid, a warning, a floating or
purposeless part, a member protruding through a plate, wrong proportions,
misplaced holes — go to step 7.

### 7. Fix

Apply the **smallest responsible** source change:
- Compile errors → load `references/repair-loop.md`, fix the line.
- `is_solid=false` → boolean op probably went wrong; reduce / restructure.
- Wrong proportions → re-check parameters against bbox.
- Hole/feature misplaced → recompute against the right reference face
  with the right selector (`.faces(">Z[1]")` etc.).

Then go back to step 5. **Soft cap: 4 iterations** before asking the user
a clarifying question. Past 4, you are probably guessing about user
intent rather than fixing a geometry bug.

### 8. Hand off

Final reply to the user (mandatory, see "Required final response" below):
the STL path, bbox + volume, parameters to tweak, and one or two
assumptions you made.

## Non-negotiables

- The agent **never** edits the generated STEP / STL / metadata sidecar.
  Edit `.py`, re-generate.
- Every generated `.py` (or project ``main.py``) defines exactly one
  ``gen_step()`` at module scope, OR for trivial single-file scripts
  assigns the final shape to a module-level ``result``. cadpy accepts
  both.
- Every CadQuery `.py` starts with `import cadquery as cq` and uses `cq.`
  throughout. CadQuery is the only modeling library available.
- Run the execution contract selected by the host before declaring done:
  `create-check` for Vibe cloud CREATE, otherwise `scripts/cad` (or at minimum
  `scripts/check`). Never claim a model is printable from reading code alone.
- Never declare done with a **blocking** warning (`disconnected_bodies`,
  `collision`, `sliver`, `invalid_brep`, `empty`, `check_failed`) **or a
  `functional` warning** in the `warnings` array, a floating/disconnected part,
  two parts that interpenetrate, or a part you cannot justify. A `functional` warning (`severity: "warning"`) means the design
  can't be assembled/used as intended (e.g. a connector that won't fit its
  opening, a coupling that doesn't engage its drive pegs, or a feature perched
  over a void) — fix it. The advisory `sharp_edges` hint (`severity: "info"`) is not
  blocking — soften what you can within printability and leave functional arrises
  sharp. In the generic/manual loop, always run `scripts/review` and `Read`
  **every** PNG it produces before declaring done (the full drill is step 6).
  In Vibe cloud CREATE, `create-check` performs that render once and its compact
  `review.targets` are the only images to read.
- Ask the user only about *personal preferences* that change geometry, and ask
  the fewest possible. Decide every *engineering* choice silently from the
  references — never ask about wall thickness, clearance, joint/fastener type,
  or print orientation. (See "Ask only about preferences".)
- Use millimeters throughout. Do not convert; do not annotate inches.

## Reference examples

Working ``.py`` files you can study (do NOT load eagerly — read on demand
when you need to mimic a pattern):

| File | Demonstrates |
|---|---|
| ``assets/example_cube_with_hole.py`` | Hello world: primitives, face selectors, ``.hole()`` |
| ``assets/example_hex_tray.py`` | Parametric grid, hex polygon math, ``.pushPoints`` |
| ``assets/example_spur_gear.py`` | Polar arrays of trapezoidal teeth, shaft bore + keyway |
| ``assets/example_twisted_vase.py`` | Multi-level loft of rotated cross-sections, ``.shell()`` for hollow walls |
| ``assets/example_gopro_mount.py`` | Multi-part union (base + stem + 3-finger head), standard GoPro spec, ``.cboreHole`` |
| ``assets/example_knurled_knob.py`` | Polar array of cutting features (knurling), chamfers, M3 set screw |
| ``assets/example_desk_valet.py`` | Premium look: unified radius language via ``cadlib.styling`` (``design_radius_for`` + ``soften_edges`` + ``break_edges``), shelled tray |
| ``assets/example_magsafe_stand.py`` | Functional integration: a captive-cable component done right — `add_open_cable_channel` (connector-clearance), hard `validate()` + soft `functional_checks()` warnings via the envelope dict |
| ``assets/example_snap_lid_box.py`` | **Multi-part fit (study this for any assembly).** A real `cq.Assembly` of base + lid as separate printed parts: the lid lip is derived from the base cavity via `cadlib.fits.peg_for` (one shared dimension), seated collision-clean, with `functional_checks()` proving it assembles |

These are the canonical patterns. Mimic the file shape: docstring at top,
named parameters at the top of the file, a single ``gen_step()`` at module
scope returning the final shape. (Some older assets still use the legacy
``result = ...`` form — copy their geometry, not that shape.)

## Progressive references

Load these only when their trigger applies (saves the host agent's context):

- `references/industrial-design.md` — the premium-product (Apple-anchored)
  aesthetic bar: unified radius language, proportion and restraint, surface
  continuity, ergonomics/texture, and printing the show-face down. **Load when
  designing or polishing the look of any user-facing part** — function and
  printability still win every conflict. Backed by `cadlib.styling` and the
  `unified-radius` / `surface-continuity` patterns.
- `references/component-integration.md` — **load before integrating any real
  component** (charger, phone, connector, motor, bearing). The discipline for
  making a design actually assemble and work: model the whole component incl.
  captive cables / connector collars, write the assembly/setup sequence, and
  enforce it with hard `validate()` asserts + soft `functional` warnings. Backed
  by `cadlib.cutouts.add_open_cable_channel` and the `cable-channel` pattern.
- `references/project-structure.md` — when to use a project directory
  vs a single file, the canonical layout, the seven rules, editing rules.
  **Load before scaffolding any multi-part design.**
- `references/literal-geometry.md` — exact final B-rep envelope and owned-void
  proofs. **Load for an overall dimension/extent, straight through-hole or
  rectangular port, or a cavity/clearance that must be empty.** The proof stays
  in source so later EDIT/REMIX turns enforce the same owner.
- `references/cadquery-modeling.md` — CadQuery idioms: workplanes, faces
  selectors, hole/cboreHole, fillet/chamfer, polygon for hex grids, loft for
  taper, common pitfalls.
- `references/hobbyist-defaults.md` — two parts: (1) how to source dimensions —
  web-search real-world product specs and state them as assumptions; (2) the
  generic FDM best-practice rules/formulas (tolerances, wall = N×nozzle,
  self-tap, cbore, bearing seat, XY-comp, elephant's foot, sanity-scale check).
- `references/repair-loop.md` — diagnosis + repair when `scripts/cad`
  returns `ok=false` or `is_solid=false`: classify the failure, the smallest
  responsible fix, when to re-render vs re-validate.
- `references/assembly.md` — `cq.Assembly` workflow for designs with
  **physically separate parts** (lid + base, hinge, removable cover, robot
  chassis + wheels). **Load before designing anything the user prints as
  multiple pieces and assembles** — using `.union()` for these instead of
  Assembly loses clearances, fits, and per-part STL export.
- `references/kinematic-placement.md` — **mechanism** placement: parts that
  share a *moving* joint or form a closed loop (four-bar / Hoeken walking legs,
  crank + coupler + rocker, scissor lift, pantograph, steering linkage). Solve
  the joint so the shared pin coincides instead of eyeballing each link's angle.
  **Load before placing any linkage** — guessed angles leave joints apart and
  trip `disconnected_bodies`. The four-bar helper lives in `cadlib.kinematics`.

## Helper library (`cadlib`)

The skill ships a Python package at `~/.claude/skills/cadcode/cadlib/`
with composable, tested CadQuery helpers. **Prefer importing these over
re-deriving geometry from the pattern docs.** The runner adds the skill
root to `sys.path`, so `from cadlib.X import Y` resolves inside the
sandbox.

```python
from cadlib.enclosure import hollow_box, add_lid_lip, lid_plate, lid_with_skirt
from cadlib.mounting  import add_screw_post, add_heat_set_pocket, add_nut_trap
from cadlib.cutouts   import (
    add_press_fit_pocket, add_magnet_pocket, add_bearing_seat, add_cable_channel,
    add_open_cable_channel,   # captive cable + connector collar (installable)
    add_rounded_side_wall_cutout, verify_side_wall_through_cut,
)
from cadlib.mechanical import add_snap_fit_cantilever, add_dovetail_slot, add_rib_stiffener
from cadlib.fits      import mating_clearance, slot_for, peg_for, print_in_place_gap  # shared mating dims
from cadlib.styling   import design_radius_for, soften_edges, break_edges
from cadlib.kinematics import solve_fourbar, place_two_point, circle_intersections
from cadlib.layout    import four_corner_points, grid_points, circle_points
from cadlib.validation import (
    verify_bbox, verify_clearance_box, verify_rectangular_through_cut,
    verify_through_hole_pattern,
)
from cadlib.tables    import (
    SCREW_TABLE, NUT_TABLE, HEATSET_TABLE, BEARING_TABLE, MAGNET_TABLE, CABLE_TABLE,
)
```

Every construction helper:

- is **keyword-only** (no positional surprises)
- **returns** a new `cq.Workplane` (does not mutate `part`)
- **raises `ValueError`** on impossible param combinations (so failures
  point at the spec, not at OCCT five frames deep)
- has a one-paragraph docstring with units + one usage example — `Read`
  the helper's source file if you want the full signature

Validation helpers are keyword-only too, but return a JSON-safe proof dict and
raise `ValueError` when the final geometry violates the supplied contract.

When **no helper fits**, write the geometry inline in a function named
`custom_<feature>()` — that's a signal the library is missing a helper,
worth promoting later. **Do not copy the pattern doc's template
verbatim** when a `cadlib` helper exists — the docs are reference, the
package is the source of truth.

For the common removable enclosure lid, keep the base as a plain
``hollow_box`` and use ``lid_with_skirt``: it creates one lid-owned annular
skirt with an open center and exact engagement depth. ``lid_plate`` keeps its
legacy solid tongue when ``lip_wall`` is omitted so existing CREATE projects
remain rebuildable. Use ``add_lid_lip`` only when the request explicitly owns a
raised rim on the base; that feature grows the base envelope.

For a rectangular opening in a +/-X or +/-Y wall, use
``add_rounded_side_wall_cutout`` instead of a one-sided inline cutter. It
overcuts into air on both sides of the wall and proves the requested aperture
on the resulting solid. After any later union or cut, call
``verify_side_wall_through_cut`` again on the final part so a subsequent
boolean cannot silently refill, shift, or enlarge the opening.

For an explicitly requested overall size or placement, call `verify_bbox` on
the owning part after its last boolean. It measures all final solids and raises
on drift; pass `None` for axes the prompt leaves open. Do not use an Assembly
bbox as a substitute for per-part ownership unless the request explicitly
constrains the assembled envelope.

For an explicitly requested Cartesian cylindrical through-hole pattern, call
`verify_through_hole_pattern` after the last boolean. It verifies exact
diameter/axis/centers/count from B-rep faces and proves the full span is air
with material around each bore. Use its optional `scope` only when another
legitimate same-diameter hole group exists on the same part.

For a sharp rectangular port through the complete X, Y, or Z span, call
`verify_rectangular_through_cut`; for a sharp axis-aligned cavity or clearance
that must contain no material, call `verify_clearance_box`. Both intersect the
complete expected volume with the final solid and prove surrounding material,
so a hidden skin, divider, refill, or oversized cut fails. Do not apply these
box proofs to rounded, tapered, keyhole, or freeform profiles.

### Recipes — worked examples to mimic

Three complete recipes live at `~/.claude/skills/cadcode/recipes/`. Read
them when designing a similar product:

| Recipe | Demonstrates |
|---|---|
| `electronics_enclosure.py` | exact shell + centered PCB posts + verified rounded side opening + lid-owned skirt + named base/lid Assembly |
| `magnetic_lid_box.py`      | wall-connected magnet supports + accessible mating-face pockets + named base/lid Assembly |
| `open_storage_bin.py`      | exact envelope + fully empty open-top cavity with five continuous walls |

The two enclosure recipes return a named `cq.Assembly`; the one-part storage
bin returns its final `cq.Workplane`. For multi-part products where each piece
prints separately, follow `references/assembly.md`—cadpy preserves part names,
colors, and locations in the STEP file.

## Pattern library

Atomic mechanical-engineering patterns, each in its own file under
`references/patterns/`. **Load only the patterns you actually need** — they
are small but adding 16 to every turn blows context. Match the user's
language to the trigger column and `Read` the corresponding file.

Each file has the same shape: **Trigger**, **Why (the mechanics)**, **CadQuery
template**, parameter ranges, and pitfalls. The template is copy-pasteable
and uses real CadQuery APIs — adapt parameters to the user's part rather
than starting from scratch.

When a design needs **multiple patterns** (e.g., enclosure with magnet
closure + screw bosses + cable channel), load all the relevant pattern
files at the start of the design phase, then weave them into one `.py`.

## Required final response

Your final reply to the user MUST contain, in order:

1. **One sentence** stating what you made (e.g., "Made a phone stand for an iPhone 15 Pro Max, 130mm tall, tilted 20°.").
2. **Output path** — the STEP for archival inspection plus the STL absolute
   path the user can drag into a slicer. **For a multi-part / assembled design,
   present the final assembled item separately from its component parts:** give
   the assembled item (the whole-scene ``<project>_assembled.stl`` +
   ``.step``, named via ``--stem`` — see step 5) as its own line first, then
   list each named component part beneath it — name, what it is, and its
   per-part view/STL from the STEP (`scripts/review` renders one PNG per part).
   The final assembled item and its parts are **distinct deliverables** — never
   collapse them into a single entry. A single-part design lists just the one item.
3. **Bounding box + volume** so the user knows it'll fit on a 200×200mm bed.
4. **Tweakable parameters** — the variables at the top of the `.py` and what they do.
5. **Assumptions** — one or two bullets for anything geometry-changing you defaulted (case allowance, screw size, tilt direction).

Skip anything else. The user wants a printable file, not a thesis.
