"""Two-part box + drop-in lid — the canonical multi-part FIT example.

Demonstrates the whole multi-part discipline in one file:
  * a real ``cq.Assembly`` of two separately-printed parts (base + lid), so each
    gets its own STL and the deterministic collision check applies;
  * ONE source-of-truth mating dimension: the lid skirt is derived from the
    base cavity via ``cadlib.fits.mating_clearance`` — the male can never drift
    from the female because both come from ``cavity`` + the FDM ``fit``;
  * parts placed in their ASSEMBLED position that touch where they mate and do
    not interpenetrate (collision-clean);
  * declared ``functional_checks`` that prove the lid actually seats and is
    removable — fit/assembly verified, not assumed.

Tweak ``Params`` and re-run. Change ``fit`` to "snug" for a firmer hold or
"free" for an easy drop-in; everything else follows.
